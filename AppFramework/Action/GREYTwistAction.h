/**
 * A @c GREYAction that performs the twist gesture on the view on which it is called.
 */
@interface GREYTwistAction : GREYBaseAction

/**
 * Performs a twist action with a given @c twistAngle over the specified @c duration.  Each
 * twist starts with two points equidistant from the view's center, moving along a circular
 * path in the appropriate direction for the specified angular distance.
 *
 * The points are spaced so that the circular path falls 80% of the way from the center point
 * to the closer of the view's bounds (horizontally or vertically).
 *
 * For a clockwise pinch, the points start out vertically aligned, to match a typical
 * thumb-and-middle-finger twist.
 *
 * For a counterclockwise pinch, the points start out horizontally aligned, to match a typical
 * index-finger-and-middle-finger twist.
 *
 * @param duration   The time interval over which the twist takes place.
 * @param twistAngle Angle of the rotation in radians.  A negative angle indicates a
 *                   clockwise twist.  A positive angle indicates a counterclockwise twist.
 *
 * @returns An instance of @c GREYTwistAction, initialized with a provided direction and
 *          duration and angle.
